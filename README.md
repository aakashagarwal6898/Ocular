Semi-Automated Document classification and data processing using Artificial Intelligence.

The main objective of this project is to develop a solution for automatically extracting information from scanned documents such as receipts, bills, invoices, etc. Overcoming the inherent unstructured nature of these invoices is one of the main goals of this project.

The output below is obtained by implementing various computer vision pre-processing algorithms and further combining it with Tesseract OCR from pyocr library.
